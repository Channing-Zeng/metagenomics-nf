# "Sars-Cov-2"-specific virus workflow

A workflow processes the following analyses that are specific to Sars-Cov-2:
    -1. Assembling and annotating the Sars-Cov-2 from Illumina or Nanopore reads
    -2. Subtyping lineage of the assembled genome
    -3. Detecting SNVs or recombinations
    -4. Detecting co-infection 
    -5. Predicting ACE2 binding sites and homologous modelling
