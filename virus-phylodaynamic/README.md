#  Analysis of virus phylodynamics during transmission

A workflow processes the following analyses:
    -1. Building a time-scale phylogenetic tree using Maximum Likelihood (ML) or Bayesian method
    -2. Estimating evolution-related parameters
    -3. Clustering (or subtyping) viral population
    -3. Estimating parameters of viral poluation genetics
    -4. Reconstructing transmission routes and transmission network
    -5. Projecting the epidemic curve
